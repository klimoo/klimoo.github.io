            If you prefer to learn in an interactive way, joining a study group or workshop might be for you! In a workshop or study group you can share your ideas with other, question each other and apply your learning materials by means of activities such as quizzes, games and other interactive exercises.

                During one of my ‘Talent and Management’ classes we saw how a mind map is a good scheming tool to revise your learning material. It provides structure and visualization of the key concepts and sharpens your visual memory. In addition, it helps you memorize, by enabling you to orally produces the information that comes along with the key words you have written down.

            <h2>mock exam</h2>
            <img class="img"     src="/afbeeldingen/yenvystudy.png" alt="Image description" style="float: right; max-width: 40%; max-height: 400px; margin-right: 50px;">
            <p style="max-width: 60%;">As a preparation for the exam of Logistics & Supply Chain Management on the 13th of January, I made the test exam and self-tests that were available on Canvas. The test included 20 multiple choice-questions and 5 open questions, covering the learning materials for the exam. I decided to make the available self-tests and mock exams for every course because they are a good resemblance of what the exam questions may look like and they help you be prepared even better. <br> <br>
                It is advisable to thoroughly go through the learning materials before attempting the practice exam. In my case, I went through the material several times and felt confident about having a complete understanding of all the information before taking the exam. I treat the practice exams like real exams, meaning that grades matter. After finishing the exam, I was pleased with my results. However, there were some problems that I encountered. <br> <br>
                I was caught off guard by the open-ended questions on the Logistics & Supply Chain Management mock exam, as it was my first trial and I was unsure of what to expect. The time limit added to my nervousness and made it challenging to maintain my focus. I was also uncertain about how the computer would evaluate my responses to the open-ended questions since the answers could vary from person to person. After completing the exam, I was able to view the corrections for the multiple-choice questions, but the evaluation of my open-ended responses was not provided. <br> <br> 
                If I had completed the mock exam a week before the actual exam, I could have solved this problem by asking the professor to review my answers. Alternatively, I could have requested the professor toupload a correction of the practice exam on Canvas for all students to access. I will keep this in mind for the second semester. <br> <br>
                Either way, taking a mock exam is definitely a good way to better prepare yourself for the actual exam. By completing the exam, you can identify the mistakes you've made, review the correct answers, and determine which learning materials require further revision. Completing a practice exam was also beneficial to me, as some of the questions that appeared on the actual exam were similar to those in the mock exam, albeit with slight differences in wording.

            <h2>Reflection on your role as chair during one of the workshops</h2>
            <p>
                During the workshop, I had the opportunity to apply the study methods, planning, summarizing, and memorization techniques that I learned in Module 8, "Business Student of Today." Together with my Talent & Management Development group, we focused on creating an interactive and creative learning environment for our classmates, using quizzes, games, and interactive exercises. <br><br>
                Reflecting on the workshop, I noticed that while the overall presentation went well, not all participants were equally engaged throughout the session. To address this, I could have involved the students more by asking more questions and encouraging them to participate more in the activities. On the other hand, I believe that my strengths in public speaking and preparedness helped guide the group through the activities effectively. I also designed a successful statement game that fostered collaboration and engagement among the participants. <br><br>
                In terms of my own participation, I felt like I contributed enough during the preparations and the workshop itself. My team divided the tasks equally, and I also provided the necessary materials and clear overviews of the information that needed to be discussed during the workshop. Moving forward, I plan to continue to develop my strengths in public speaking and facilitation, and to implement the strategies and techniques I learned from the module into my own study habits. <br><br>
            </p>
            <h2>Reflection on your role as participant during one of the workshops</h2>
            <p>
                Being a participant is equally as interesting as being a chairperson. One workshop I participated in covered the topic of effective and efficient planning. To make the workshop more engaging, the organizers divided the class into groups and assigned each group a different situation. Our group received a scenario that described the busy schedule of a fictional person, and it was our task to plan out their upcoming two weeks in a realistic and feasible manner, while considering potential unexpected events. <br><br>
                The workshop provided valuable insights into effective planning strategies, offering various tips and tricks. One key lesson I learned was the importance of scheduling half a day each week as "empty" time in case emergencies or unexpected events pop up. If a sudden occurrence prevents you from completing planned tasks on a particular day, you can then move those tasks to the empty slot and complete them at a later time. The organizers were also available to provide guidance if any group was struggling with creating the planning. <br><br>
                Overall, the workshop was insightful and highly interactive. I appreciated the opportunity to learn new strategies for effective planning. <br><br>
