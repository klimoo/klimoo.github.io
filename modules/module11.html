    <div style="margin: 50px;">
        <h2>Situation 1: A team member does not submit their part of the work before the agreed deadline</h2>
        <p>To ensure accountability and timely delivery of tasks, the team should create a clear plan that includes defining deadlines and responsibilities for each member, and regularly checking in on progress. If a team member fails to submit their part on time, the first response should be to contact them immediately via the WhatsApp group chat. The team member who missed the deadline should provide an apology and an explanation for their delay. If the team member cannot be reached, other team members should take over their responsibilities and try to contact the missing member via email or other applications. Finally, the situation should be discussed in the next team meeting to prevent similar delays in the future.</p>
        <h2>Situation 2: There is a lack of communication within the team</h2>
        <p>Effective communication is crucial to any team's success. One effective approach is to organize a meeting, either virtual or in-person, where all team members can actively participate and voice their thoughts and concerns. During the discussion, it is important to actively listen to each other's opinions and empathize with each otherâ€™s feelings while supporting statements with clear examples. In addition, the team should review the team charter and make necessary adjustments to enhance communication. It is also important to collectively identify areas where team members need to improve their communication skills. Lastly, regular team meetings should be scheduled to ensure ongoing communication and collaboration.</p>
        <h2>Situation 3: A team member has difficulty completing their part because of a busy schedule or not understanding the assignment</h2>
        <p>Creating a supportive environment is key to overcoming challenges within the team. As a team, we should encourage open communication by creating a safe space where every team member can freely express their difficulties and concerns. As a response to difficulties, the team can utilize the WhatsApp group chat to facilitate discussions and provide clear and structured answers to those in need. If a task seems overwhelming or there's a lack of time, we should consider redividing tasks or team members should take initiative to ask other team members for help. Furthermore, decisions about task divisions should be made by consensus to ensure fairness. Regularly checking in with team members who are having difficulties can help them stay on track and feel supported throughout the process.
            <br> <br>
            By implementing these action plans, the team can proactively address and resolve conflicts that may arise during work. Creating a supportive environment and regularly checking in with team members can help prevent conflicts from arising in the first place. Defining clear responsibilities and deadlines, improving communication, and working collaboratively can ensure that the team achieves its goals effectively and efficiently.
