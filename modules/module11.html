        <h3>Comments</h3>
        <br>
        <p>Dangelo meets the expectations for communication behavior. As a team member, he was present during all the visual meetings on teams and the in-person meetings. However, I believe that he can be more present during the meetings as he tends to be quiet.</p>
        <br>

        <h3>Observed Behaviours</h3>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>Dangelo was present during the leadership forum and he interacted with the managers that were being interviewed.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Dangelo joined every team meeting and he arrived on time. He did not leave the meeting before it came to an end.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h3>Impact</h3>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>Being present and engaging in the team meetings had a positive impact on the group because, as a group, we were able to receive updates on the progress of his designated tasks. Dangelo engaged in the brainstorming activity about possible interview questions. And he brought some good questions forward. Putting his ideas into words positively influenced the thinking progress of the group.</li>
            <br>
            <li>I noticed that Dangelo was a little quiet sometimes and that he is a person who is less likely to take initiative. Dangelo seems to be a person who rather follows orders than leading the group through the process of completing the assignment successfully. These characteristic traits influenced the communication negatively, as he did not voice much input. Although, there are benefits to varieties in personalities within a group or team. In a team where everyone has the same character, conflict becomes more frequent. Such teams are also less likely to generate creative ideas. </li>
            <br>
            <li>As Dangelo has a busy schedule outside of school, he often had time constraints regarding meetings. He seemed rushed which might have negatively influenced the group since there was an urgency to discuss things rapidly. It was a good idea of him to inform the team members about his time limits before the start of meetings. This way, the team could prepare itself better and make changes to the agenda if necessary.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h3>Recommendations</h3>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>I feel Dangelo could come more on the foreground of discussions to voice his opinions and ideas. This can be beneficial to the team as we can view things from multiple perspectives.</li>
            <br>
            <li>I find it positive that Dangelo was not afraid to ask questions when he was not certain about something. It is important for a team to avoid miscommunication and to ensure everyone is on the same page. If not, progress could be slowed down. This is why Dangelo should continue asking questions in case of uncertainty as it is beneficial not only for him as an individual but also for his team.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Comments</h3><br>
        <p>Dangelo is not meeting the expectations for quality of work because his work was unorganized and contained multiple grammatical and vocabulary mistakes. For a minority of his tasks, he did not meet the requirements or he did not submit his part before the deadline was due.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Observed Behaviours</h3>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>For each interview during the leadership event, we assigned a different person to take notes. As required, Dangelo took notes of his assigned interview. However, his notes contained grammatical errors and lacked structure. Moreover, he was not always paying attention to what was being said.</li>
            <br>
            <li>When working on the TMD workshop about managing change and innovation, Dangelo had to submit his summary or scheme (e.g. a mind map) which summarizes a part in our course book. After multiple reminders, this was not done. He did not upload his summary or scheme on the designated time.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h3>Impact</h3>
        <br>
        <p>The team was negatively impacted by his quality of work. The fact that he did not meet the agreed deadline and there was a lack of structure and legibility, slowed the progress we made on the assignment down.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Recommendations</h3>
        <br>
        <p>Some part still contained typos, which can cause discomfort for other people since they would have to proofread and correct the mistakes. For example, with the taken notes of the interview. It feels to me like Dangelo might not always proofread his stuff before sending it over. Making a planning, as seen in previous modules, might help him to meet deadlines. By making an effective planning, he can divide his work efficiently and other team members won’t have to stress about unfished tasks. There is still some room for improvement, but I am sure he will take those recommendations into account and actively work on his improvement areas.</p>

        <h3>Comments</h3>
        <br>
        <p>Dangelo partially meets the expectations for demonstrating respect for team members, because he initiated asking for his team members opinions in discussions and he asks for feedback on the ideas he brought forward but he did not explicitly support or encourage anyone.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Observed Behaviours</h3>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>When uploading the interview questions in the group chat, he asked about the opinion of every group member about them. He asked if there was something anyone wanted to add or change?</li>
            <br>
            <li>Dangelo showed no contradictory behavior when tasks were divided. He himself took the initiative to perform a certain task.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h3>Impact</h3>
        <br>
        <p>The team was positively impacted by Dangelo’s actions. He made sure that everyone was heard, including himself and he asked for feedback on certain matters. Feedback is important. It offers criticism and enables individuals to see what may be altered to achieve better results.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Recommendations</h3>
        <br>
        <p>Continue asking about the opinion of others but also try to help, support, and encourage your team members.</p>

        <h3>Comments</h3>
        <br>
        <p>I meet the expectations for the communication behaviors. I am active in the oral communication as well as the written communication. I remind my teammates about deadlines, meetings, and requirements of tasks in the WhatsApp-group chat. I am also an active listener and try to engage everyone in the team by asking about their opinions and ideas.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Observed Behaviours</h3>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>For the leadership event we were expected to dress formal. I reminded my teammates about this matter. </li>
            <br>
            <li>I was responsible for handing in the leadership forum which included our interview questions, information about our chosen manager and a task division. I asked my teammates in the group chat to look at what I wrote and to let me know if they wanted to change something about the text or lay-out before submitting.</li>
            <br>
            <li>I helped brainstorming about possible interview questions. Together we came up with a list of good questions. </li>
            <br>
            <li>I actively helped searching for a manager to interview.  We were able to interview my aunt, a Corporate Communication Manager at Reynaers Group, who I was able to contact through a phone call. I informed my team members about the positive news straight away and her function in the company she works for. It was important that everyone was in consensus about the chosen manager. </li>
            <br>
            <li>Giving explanations and instructions about the tasks so we can complete it successfully (e.g., requirements). Helping others when they are unsure about something by replying quickly to their messages.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h3>Impact</h3>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>Being active in the group chat positively impacted my team because they were able to receive reminders about deadlines, timely answers to questions but also updates on my personal progress. </li>
            <br>
            <li>I often gave feedback and asked for feedback from others. I believe this is a positive contribution to the project.</li>
            <br>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h3>Recommendations</h3>
        <br>
        <p>I should strive to trust and include others in the project more by giving them greater responsibilities. I tend to take many tasks on myself because I am afraid someone else might not complete their part correctly as a response to previous bad experience. Trust is important within a team.</p>

            <br>
            <li>I wrote down deadlines and made a personal log of each meeting. This log mainly included what had been discussed, what still had to be done, the deadlines and task-division.</li>

            I am a critical thinker and have an eye for detail. I think this impacted our team in a positive way. By thinking critically about the interview questions and paying attention to details in our submitted document, we could correct typos, grammatical mistakes, and other areas where improvement was necessary, to achieve better results. 
            <br>
            Moreover, I noticed the team is impacted by the punctuality and quality I deliver in my work. I make sure I finish my work by the due date so that we, as a group, are not held back by an unfinished part of the assignment.
        </p>

        <h3>Recommendations</h3>
        <br>
        <p>I feel that I had a positive impact on the group regarding the quality of our work. That is why I should continue completing my work before the deadline, completing my tasks with quality and professionalism, and proofreading my part of the assignment, as well as those of others,  before submitting the final version. </p>

        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>Every team meeting, virtual or in person, I address each team member and ask for their opinion or ideas on certain matters. </li>
            <br>
            <li>At the end of every team meeting, I ask if anyone has a question or if there is anything else someone wants to discuss.</li>
            <br>
            <li>At the end of every meeting, I tend to give a brief summary on what has been discussed.</li>
            <br>
            <li>During the second meeting, a clear task division had been made. I compromised in deciding how the work should be divided and asked if everyone was satisfied with the division or if they would like to change something.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h3>Impact</h3>
        <br>
        <p>I think my behavior had a positive impact on the team. Personally, I find it important that in a groupwork, everyone’s voice is being heard. By voicing multiple opinions and giving everyone an equal chance to speak, you can not only improve the work you will deliver as a team but also grow as a team. My teammates seemed to appreciate my initiative to seek out the opinions of the other team members. It made the other team members feel heard and more at ease. Support was also given to team members who required it, along with advice.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Recommendations</h3>
        <br>
        <p>I noticed that asking about other people’s opinions and replying to questions had a positive impact. That is why I should continue helping those who struggle with their work or those who seem to hold back their feelings or opinions. I tend to take on a leadership role during group assignments. However, I feel that during this assignment, I played more of an assisting and verifying role.</p>

    <h1>Action plan</h1>
    <hr>
    <div style="margin: 50px;">
        <h2>Situation 1: A team member does not submit their part of the work before the agreed deadline</h2>   
        <p>To ensure accountability and timely delivery of tasks, the team should create a clear plan that includes defining deadlines and responsibilities for each member, and regularly checking in on progress. If a team member fails to submit their part on time, the first response should be to contact them immediately via the WhatsApp group chat. The team member who missed the deadline should provide an apology and an explanation for their delay. If the team member cannot be reached, other team members should take over their responsibilities and try to contact the missing member via email or other applications. Finally, the situation should be discussed in the next team meeting to prevent similar delays in the future.</p>
        <h2>Situation 2: There is a lack of communication within the team</h2>
        <p>Effective communication is crucial to any team's success. One effective approach is to organize a meeting, either virtual or in-person, where all team members can actively participate and voice their thoughts and concerns. During the discussion, it is important to actively listen to each other's opinions and empathize with each other’s feelings while supporting statements with clear examples. In addition, the team should review the team charter and make necessary adjustments to enhance communication. It is also important to collectively identify areas where team members need to improve their communication skills. Lastly, regular team meetings should be scheduled to ensure ongoing communication and collaboration.</p>

        <p>Creating a supportive environment is key to overcoming challenges within the team. As a team, we should encourage open communication by creating a safe space where every team member can freely express their difficulties and concerns. As a response to difficulties, the team can utilize the WhatsApp group chat to facilitate discussions and provide clear and structured answers to those in need. If a task seems overwhelming or there's a lack of time, we should consider redividing tasks or team members should take initiative to ask other team members for help. Furthermore, decisions about task divisions should be made by consensus to ensure fairness. Regularly checking in with team members who are having difficulties can help them stay on track and feel supported throughout the process.

            By implementing these action plans, the team can proactively address and resolve conflicts that may arise during work. Creating a supportive environment and regularly checking in with team members can help prevent conflicts from arising in the first place. Defining clear responsibilities and deadlines, improving communication, and working collaboratively can ensure that the team achieves its goals effectively and efficiently.
